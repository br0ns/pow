# `pow`: Proof of Work generator

## What is it?

It is common for CTF challenge services to require a proof of work
([POW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system)) in order to reduce
load on the infrastructure (and counter DoS attacks).

This program produces such proofs of work.

## How do I build it?

```

```

## How do I use it?
